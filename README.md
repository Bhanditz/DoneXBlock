Lets a student mark they've finished an activity

FutureLearn uses this kind of thing to great effect. Students can 
read text, watch videos, etc., and mark when their done. Honor 
code grading, and convenient progress indication. 

I copied some of the UX patterns from FutureLearn so that users of
both platforms would have some level of consistent user experience and
expectations between MOOCs. I didn't copy them exactly since I'm
unfamiliar with copyright or trademark issues around look-and-feel,
and this was on a short anough timeline that I did not have a chance
to reach out to FutureLearn for permission. This is probably worth
doing -- it'd be to the benefit of learners on all platforms and the
industry as a whole if we could aim for consistency of experience
between platforms where convenient.

Limitations: 

* We can only have one of these per page. I'm waiting on XBlocks to
  have a more mature client-side framework, since right now, managing
  multiple per page would be messy.
